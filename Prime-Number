# Code to check whether a number is Prime or NOT

print("Please Enter Number Above 2 To check Number is Prime or Not")
num = int(input("Enter Number Here >>> : "))
divisible = False
i = 2

while i < num:
    if (num % i == 0):
        divisible = True;
        print(f"{num} is Divisble by {i}")
    i += 1

if divisible:
    print("Number >>> {} is Not Prime".format(num))
else:
    print(f"Number >>> {num} is Prime")
    
    
    *** OUTPUT ***
    
    
    
Enter Number Here >>> : 12
12 is Divisble by 2
12 is Divisble by 3
12 is Divisble by 4
12 is Divisble by 6
Number >>> 12 is Not Prime
